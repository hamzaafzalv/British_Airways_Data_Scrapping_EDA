# British_Airways_Data_Scrapping_EDA
As a virtual intern at British Airways, I have been tasked with collecting, cleaning, and analyzing customer reviews to gain valuable insights into customer satisfaction. To achieve this, I used the web scraping library, Beautiful Soup, to gather data from review websites. The data was then cleaned and preprocessed using popular libraries such as Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib in Python. The cleaning process involved identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and missing values in the data, ensuring its accuracy and completeness for further analysis. In this project, I will also use popular data visualization libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly to uncover key trends and patterns in customer feedback. The goal is to provide actionable insights into customer experiences and help improve customer satisfaction for British Airways.
